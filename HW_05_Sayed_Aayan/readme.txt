Project: Mininet 
Description: 
The goal of the project is utlizing mininet to create subnets that satisfy specified requirements. 
There are three routers A, B, and C, each of which is connected to two hosts. 

1) How to compile and run the code:
    1) Clone the github repository to access the python code and the dependencies (can make a virtual environment using python)
    2) Check if python is downloaded on the system
    3) install the requirements needed to run the code 

You will need Mininet already running in a Ubuntu or Linux Virtual environment. Once you have Mininet up and running you will need to 
Mount the layer3_network_code.py onto the VM and run it in a shell. From there the script can be run like a normal python script.

layer3_network_code: 
This code configures the 3 subnets we created for Task 1.   
    Ex: python3 layer3_network_code.py
